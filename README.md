# TT homeworks

You can find script ```do``` to run full lifecycle
of stack build tool (clean, build and run). Use ```run```
script to just run code. Both scripts require exactly one
command line argument - number from 1 to 6, each one relates
to homeworks respectively. Use files in directory ```tests```
to see files for testing homeworks. File ```test<n>.in``` is for
input and ```test<n>.out``` is for output, where ```<n>``` is the
number of homework. You need to have stack build tool installed
on your computer in order to run this homework. There are also
windows versions of scripts - ```do.bat``` and ```run.bat```. I hope
they work.
